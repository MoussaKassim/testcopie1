# Introduction
This page provides code to reproduce all the simulation results for BASS.
Hopefully, this can also serve as a resource for building up your simulation 
studies and evaluate your statistical methods.

# Main simulation study
## Generate simulated data
The simulation study relies on a few R packages and python softwares
(e.g. SpaGCN and FICT), which need to be installed beforehand. The specific 
packages and all necessary functions to conduct the simulation study can be 
found at [simulation][].

```{r}
source("code/simu_utils.R")
# data from STARmap (BZ5) for inferring parameters for splatter
cnts <- readRDS("data/simu_cnts.RDS")
info <- readRDS("data/simu_info.RDS")
xy <- as.matrix(info[, c("x", "y")])
starmap <- list(cnts = cnts, info = info)

# we perform 50 simulation replicates under each setting and
# the random seeds used for each replicate are generated as below
NREP <- 50
set.seed(0)
seeds <- sample(20201230, NREP)
```

We generate the simulated data under the baseline simulation setting. Refer to 
the [params][] file for a complete list of simulation settings.
```{r}
# baseline setting of all four scenarios for 
# the single tissue section analysis (L = 1)
scenarios <- 1:4 # simulation scenarios
C <- 4 # number of cell types
R <- 4 # number of spatial domains
J <- 200 # number of genes
de_prop <- 0.2 # proportion of DE genes for each cell type
de_facLoc <- 1.1 # DE gene strength
L <- 1 # number of tissue sections

# illustrate the data at the first replicate
rep <- 1
sim_dats <- lapply(scenarios, function(scenario){
  simu(starmap = starmap, scenario = scenario, C = C, J = J, L = L, 
    batch_facLoc = 0, de_prop = de_prop, de_facLoc = de_facLoc, 
    de_facScale = 0.4, sim_seed = seeds[rep], debug = FALSE)
})
```

```{r}
# The simulated data include an L-list of gene expression count matrices,
# an L-list of true cell type label vectors for evaluation purpose, and 
# the random seed used for generating the data
scenario <- 3
sim_dat <- sim_dats[[scenario]]
# gene expression count matrix of the first tissue section under scenario 3
sim_dat[[1]][[1]][1:5, 1:5]
```

## Visualize the simulated data
We visualize the cell type distributions under scenarios I-IV. You can refer to 
[visualization][] for some useful plotting functions or you can write your own 
code for plotting.
```{r}
library(cowplot)
source("code/viz.R")
p <- lapply(scenarios, function(scenario){
  plotClusters(xy, labels = sim_dats[[scenario]][[2]][[1]], 
    title = paste("Scenario", c("I", "II", "III", "IV")[scenario]))
})
legend <- get_legend(p[[1]] + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Cell type")))
p <- plot_grid(plotlist = p, ncol = 2)
plot_grid(p, legend, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1, 0.1))
```

## Running all methods
We have wrapped up code for running different methods into different functions. 
Those functions take in simulated data and output various evaluation quantities 
that include the adjusted random index (ARI), $F_1$ score, Matthew's correlation 
coefficient (MCC), estimated number of cell types/spatial domains, and 
proportions of cells in each cell type/spatial domain. There, ARI, which was 
used as a major evaluation metric in our study, measures the similarity between 
the estimated cell type/spatial domain labels and the underlying truth. 
Functions for running different methods can be found at [simulation][]. We take 
the simulated data from scenario 3 as an example to illustrate running different 
methods.
```{r}
scenario <- 3
```

### Run BASS

```{r}
BASS_out <- run_BASS(sim_dats[[scenario]], xy, "SW", 
  beta = 1, C, R, init_method = "kmeans")
```
Note that for cell type clustering, we evaluate three metrics that include the 
ARI, $F_1$-score, and MCC. The three metrics are evaluated in all cells, cells 
of major types, and cells of rare types. In our main simulation study, we 
focus on the ARI evaluated in all cells. The other quantities are relevant to 
the additional simulation studies where we evaluate the influence of rare cell 
types on the performance of all methods. Refer to the simulation section of our 
paper for details.
```{r}
BASS_out
```

### Run HMRF
Please note that running HMRF requires you to specify a path to python and will 
generate intermediate and final results into a specified folder. Please modify 
those directories accordingly in the `run_HMRF` function if you want to use the 
function for your own analysis.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Note that case and rep parameters below are used to generate 
# a unique temporary directories for running HMRF.
HMRF_out <- run_HMRF(sim_dat, xy, ztrue = info$z, R, case = 3, 
  rep, usePCs = F, dosearchSEgenes = T)
```
```{r}
# ARI for spatial domain detection across different
# spatial interaction parameter betas.
unlist(HMRF_out$ari)
```

### Run BayesSpace
Note that BayesSpace cannot identify any neighbors because it was developed for
analyzing ordered lattice structure of spots from ST or 10x Visium platform.
```{r}
BayesSpace_out <- run_BayesSpace(sim_dat, xy, ztrue = info$z, R)
# ARI for spatial domain detection, estimated number of domains,
# and proportions of cells in each domain
BayesSpace_out
```

### Run SpaGCN
Because SpaGCN was originally developed with Python, we wrapped up the python 
code into a function and have it imported into R such that we can conveniently 
analyze the simulated data in R. The python function can be found at [simulation][].
```{r}
source_python("code/run_SpaGCN.py")
SpaGCN_out <- run_SpaGCN(sim_dat, xy, info$z, R)
# ARI for spatial domain detection, estimated number of domains,
# and proportions of cells in each domain
SpaGCN_out
```

### Run Seurat
Because Seurat uses a resolution parameter to indirectly determine the number of 
clusters, we run Seurat on a range of resolution parameters and identify the 
first value that resulted in the desired number of cell types.
```{r}
resolutions <- seq(0.1, 4, by = 0.1)
seu_out <- seu_cluster(sim_dat, C, resolutions)
# ARI, F1-score, and MCC for cell type clustering, 
# number of identified clusters, and the proportion 
# of cells in each cell type cluster.
seu_out
```

### Run SC3
Note that when the number of cells exceeds 5,000, SC3 randomly selects 5,000 
cells for clustering, trains a support vector machine with the cluster labels 
obtained from the 5,000 cells, and then predict the cluster labels of the 
remaining cells.
```{r}
# Note that SC3 is slow
sc3_out <- sc3_cluster(sim_dat, C)
# ARI, F1-score, and MCC for cell type clustering, 
# number of identified clusters, and the proportion 
# of cells in each cell type cluster.
sc3_out
```

### Run FICT
Please install the software according to the 
[FICT github](https://github.com/haotianteng/FICT) and modify the paths to the 
FICT software and a temporary folder accordingly in the `fict_cluster` function.
```{r}
# Note that case and rep parameters below are used to generate 
# a unique temporary directories for running FICT.
fict_out <- fict_cluster(sim_dat, xy, C, case = 3, rep)
# ARI, F1-score, and MCC for cell type clustering, 
# number of identified clusters, and the proportion 
# of cells in each cell type cluster.
fict_out
```

# Multi-sample simulation
In addition to simulating and analyzing a single tissue section, we also 
simulated multiple tissue sections and evaluated the performance of BASS for 
multi-sample integrative analysis. Specifically, we generated additional tissue 
sections based on the same spatial locations of the 1,127 cells in the single 
tissue section analysis but with slightly different spatial domain allocations 
for them, creating varying spatial domain boundaries between the four cortical 
layers on different tissue sections. In each section, we set the spatial domain 
boundaries to be vertical, and created new boundaries by horizontally moving the 
original boundaries based on a uniform distribution with step size set to be
approximately 10% (= 500) of the tissue width. The resulting new tissue sections 
are as follows.
![](add_tis_sects.png)

Here, similar to the single-sample analysis, we generate the simulated data 
under the baseline simulation setting but for five tissue sections (`L = 5`). 
Refer to the [params_mult][] file for a complete list of simulation settings.
```{r}
# generate simulated data for five tissue sections
L <- 5
sim_dat <- simu(
  starmap = starmap, scenario = scenario, C = C, J = J, L = L, 
  batch_facLoc = 0, de_prop = de_prop, de_facLoc = de_facLoc, 
  de_facScale = 0.4, sim_seed = seeds[rep], debug = FALSE)
# run BASS
BASS_out <- run_BASS(sim_dat, xy, "SW", beta = 1, 
  C, R, init_method = "kmeans")
BASS_out
```

# Additional simulations
Besides the main simulations above, we also performed additional simulations to 
evaluate the influence of various other factors – including the specified number 
of cell types and spatial domains, rare cell types, and a random exclusion of 
genes – on method performance. Please check the simulation section of our paper 
for detailed description of the simulation design. A list of simulation settings 
and code for running the simulation and for plotting can be found 
[here](https://github.com/zhengli09/BASS-Analysis/tree/master/code/add_simu).

## Influence of the specified number of cell types and spatial domains
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
sim_dat <- sim_dats[[scenario]]
# over-specify the number of cell types (C)
BASS_overC <- run_BASS(sim_dat, xy, "SW", beta = 1, 
  C = 10, R = 4, init_method = "kmeans")
```
```{r}
# Note that the proportions of cells in the redundant clusters are 
# small and the spatial domain detection is only slightly affected
BASS_overC
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# over-specify the number of spatial domains (R)
BASS_overR <- run_BASS(sim_dat, xy, "SW", beta = 1, 
  C = 4, R = 10, init_method = "kmeans")
```
```{r}
# Note that the proportions of cells in the redundant domains are 
# small and the cell type clustering is only slightly affected
BASS_overR
```

## Influence of rare cell types

```{r}
# rare_dist = spatial/random indicates that the rare cell types 
# are either located in specific domains or distributed randomly 
# across the entire tissue section
# C = 10/14 (4 major cell types + 6/10 rare cell types)
# major cell types consist of 70% of cells in the data while
# rare cell types consist of the remaining 30% of cells
sim_dat_rare <- simu(starmap, scenario = 5, rare_dist = "spatial",
  C = 14, J = 200, L = 1, batch_facLoc = 0, de_prop = 0.2, 
  de_facLoc = 1.1, de_facScale = 0.4, sim_seed = seeds[rep])
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
BASS_rare <- run_BASS(sim_dat_rare, xy, "SW", beta = 1, 
  C = 14, R = 4, init_method = "kmeans")
```
```{r}
BASS_rare
```

## Influence of a random exclusion of genes

```{r}
# I = 100, 200, or 500 indicates the number of retained genes 
# while the total number of genes is 1000 in the original gene 
# expression matrix
sim_dat_rand_excl <- simu(starmap, scenario = 3, C = 4, 
  J = 1000, I = 200, L = 1, batch_facLoc = 0, de_prop = 0.2, 
  de_facLoc = 1.1, de_facScale = 0.4, sim_seed = seeds[rep])
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
BASS_rand_excl <- run_BASS(sim_dat_rand_excl, xy, "SW", 
  beta = 1, C = 4, R = 4, init_method = "kmeans")
```
```{r}
BASS_rand_excl
```
